- 👋 Hi, my name is Truong Thanh Thien. I graduated from the University of Information Technology VNU-HCMC.
- 👀 My objective is to become an expert in Software Testing. Bring professional products not only quality but also high performance for end users. To do that, I want to challenge myself in projects at companies where I can express my knowledge and skills to bring good and creative solutions. From that, I update myself every day to be ready for the next projects and finish them in less time with high quality.  
- 🌱 Besides, I am also interested in the Data field. Each data always has its own story, containing useful information. If we explore those stories and transfer them to the audience, it assists to put out exactly important decisions with less risk to get more benefits on an allowable budget.
